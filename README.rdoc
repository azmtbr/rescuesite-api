## Rescue Site

While I've used template-based solutions such as Squarespace, Wix, and others to help rescues enhance their online presence, I've come to realize that these services need to be upgraded to cater to a wider range of uses. MyRescueSite is designed to offer specific features that a rescue employs in its day-to-day operations. My aim is to ensure that those features are as user-friendly and as efficient as possible.

The app is being built with a Rails API as a back-end and using AngularJS for the front-end. I enjoy working with Angular and being able to take advantage of its two-way binding. I think its implementation will make for a great user experience, not only for the visitors to these sites, but for the animal rescue staff that has to edit and maintain them.
